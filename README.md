## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS BEM
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- CSS "Grid" and "BEM" are best techniques to solve any complex design styling
- This helps with magic numbers being used in margin, padding etc
- No need to use CSS position at all
- More learnings wrt CSS Grid items positioning and aligning
- More learnings wrt CSS width & best practices
- More learnings wrt Semantic HTML
- In FF devtool, you can modify height, width with scroll bar kind of action

### Continued development

- More practice, reading, study is needed wrt BEM, SEO, Accessibility, CSS
